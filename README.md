Cloud computing: Cloud computing has become a popular option for storing and accessing data, but it also poses significant risks to privacy and intellectual property. The cloud stores data on remote servers, which can be accessed by multiple parties, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and loss of control over sensitive information.

Big data analytics: With the growth of big data, organizations are able to collect and analyze massive amounts of data from various sources. While this can lead to more personalized and effective services, it also poses significant risks to privacy and intellectual property. For example, personal data collected by health insurers or credit agencies can be used to discriminate against individuals or unfairly deny them access to services.

Online surveillance and censorship: Governments and organizations have the ability to monitor online activity, which can be used to identify and track individuals or restrict access to information. This can lead to concerns about censorship and infringements on individual freedom of speech and expression.

Lack of digital literacy: Many individuals lack the necessary digital literacy skills to understand the risks associated with sharing personal information online or using digital technologies. This can lead to a lack of awareness about the potential risks and challenges associated with contemporary information systems technology and the internet.

Exploitation of vulnerable populations: The use of digital technologies and the internet can exacerbate existing inequalities and vulnerabilities, particularly for marginalized populations. For example, online harassment and cyberbullying can disproportionately affect women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals, while the use of AI and machine learning algorithms can perpetuate biases and discrimination.
