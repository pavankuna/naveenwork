Based on the provided Wireshark network trace, it is not possible to determine the specific type of attack that is currently happening against the server. However, the zero window size (WIN=0) and length of window (LWN=0) values in the TCP SYN-ACK packet may indicate that the server is experiencing network-related issues, such as congestion or resource exhaustion.

One possible type of attack that could cause this issue is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, which floods a target server with a high volume of traffic or requests to overwhelm its resources and make it inaccessible to legitimate users. This can be achieved using various methods, such as:

Network-based DoS: This type of attack floods the target server with a large number of packets or connections to consume its network bandwidth or processing power. Examples include SYN flood attacks, UDP flood attacks, and ICMP flood attacks.

Application-based DoS: This type of attack targets specific applications or services running on the target server, such as web servers, by sending malformed or malicious requests to exhaust their resources. Examples include HTTP flood attacks, Slowloris attacks, and DNS amplification attacks.

         |                                  |

n this example, the attacker spoofs the source IP address in the SYN packets to make it difficult for the target server to identify the source of the attack. The target server responds with SYN-ACK packets, but since the attacker does not send ACK packets, the connection remains open and consumes the server's resources. As a result, the server becomes slow and unresponsive, and may eventually crash or become unavailable to legitimate users.

To defend against DoS attacks, network administrators can use various techniques, such as implementing rate-limiting policies, using firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and deploying load balancers or content delivery networks (CDN) to distribute the traffic across multiple servers. Application developers can also implement techniques such as captcha challenges or rate limiting to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks on their web applications.

but if we assume that it is a network-based DoS attack, it usually occurs in the following manner:

The attacker sends a large number of packets or connection requests to the target server, typically using spoofed IP addresses or botnets to make it difficult to trace the source of the attack.

The target server receives these packets and tries to respond to them, but due to the high volume of traffic, its resources such as bandwidth, CPU, or memory get exhausted, leading to network congestion or slow response times.

As the server's resources get consumed, it may not be able to respond to legitimate requests, leading to service disruption or downtime.

In some cases, the server may become completely unresponsive or crash due to the overwhelming volume of traffic.

The attacker may continue the attack for an extended period, periodically changing the source IP addresses or patterns of the attack to avoid detection or mitigation.

To defend against such attacks, various techniques can be used such as:

Implementing rate-limiting policies on the server or network devices to limit the number of packets or connections that can be received from a single IP address.

Deploying firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and content delivery networks (CDNs) to filter out malicious traffic and distribute the load across multiple servers.

Monitoring the network traffic using tools such as Wireshark or NetFlow to detect patterns of abnormal traffic and take appropriate action.

Using cloud-based or third-party services that offer DDoS protection and mitigation capabilities.

Educating end-users about the risks of DoS attacks and the importance of maintaining strong passwords, patching software, and not clicking on suspicious links or attachments.
