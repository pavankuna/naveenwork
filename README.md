Due to the following factors, modern information systems technology and the internet provide problems to the protection of individual privacy and intellectual property.

With the spread of digital technology, businesses are gathering enormous amounts of data on people through tools like internet cookies, social media tracking, and mobile device location tracking. This makes it simpler to create comprehensive profiles of people that include their interests, activities, and preferences so that they can be targeted with tailored advertising or other forms of control.

Weak security measures: The lack of strong security measures in many firms makes it simpler for hackers to steal confidential information or intellectual property. Hackers can access private information, including credit card numbers. The cloud stores data on remote servers, which can be accessed by multiple parties, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and loss of control over sensitive information.

Internet's worldwide nature makes it challenging to apply rules and regulations across different jurisdictions. The internet is a global network. This makes it simpler for people and organizations to partake in illegal actions like sharing content that is protected by the copyright law or cyberbullying that violates the rights of others to privacy or property.

Controlling the release of sensitive information is challenging because users may unintentionally reveal personal information or intellectual property, such as copyrighted content or company secrets, with a large audience.

Use of artificial intelligence and machine learning: A lot of businesses are analyzing huge volumes of data, which may include personal data, using AI and machine learning algorithms. These technologies are able to spot trends and forecast people's behavior, which can be applied to targeted advertising or other uses. These algorithms run the danger of being biased or erroneous, which could result in unjust treatment or discrimination.

Lack of transparency and control: Many people are unaware of the amount to which businesses are gathering and using their personal information, and they might not have any control over it.

Increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks: The risk of cyber attacks rises as organizations depend more on digital technology. Cybercriminals are growing more expert in their techniques, and they are now able to obtain confidential information or valuable intellectual property by taking advantage of holes in the internet and information systems technology.

As a result of a number of factors, including data collection and tracking, lax security protocols, global reach, a lack of transparency and control, emerging technologies, regulatory issues, and cyberattacks, modern information systems technology and the internet pose serious challenges to the protection of individual privacy and intellectual property. In this complicated and dynamic environment, it is crucial for individuals and businesses to exercise caution and take preventative actions to safeguard their intellectual property.
