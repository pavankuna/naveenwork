A supply chain refers to the network of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in the creation and delivery of a product or service to customers. It involves all the steps and processes from the sourcing of raw materials to the delivery of the final product or service to the end customer.

A supply chain management system is a software application that helps businesses manage and optimize their supply chain processes. It provides tools and functionalities that enable businesses to track and manage inventory, monitor supplier performance, manage logistics and transportation, and coordinate the flow of goods and services from suppliers to customers.

A supply chain management system typically includes modules for procurement, inventory management, order management, warehouse management, transportation management, and analytics. These modules provide businesses with real-time visibility into their supply chain operations, enabling them to identify and address issues and optimize their processes.
