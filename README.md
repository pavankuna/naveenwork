A solution to the key exchange problem was necessary for modern secure communications because earlier key exchange techniques were insufficiently safe to thwart hacker interceptions and eavesdropping.

The difficulty of safely exchanging cryptographic keys between two parties so that they can communicate secretively without running the danger of having their communication intercepted or modified with by an attacker is referred to as the "key exchange problem." Traditional key exchange techniques were insufficiently secure since they were open to interceptions, eavesdropping, and other attacks, such as manually exchanging keys or using a public directory.

Public key cryptography and key exchange protocols, which enable parties to safely exchange keys without the need for pre-shared keys or public directories, are used in current secure communications to address this issue. Each side uses a public key and a private key in public key cryptography, and because the keys are mathematically connected, anything encrypted with one key can only be unlocked with the other key.
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is an illustration of a key exchange protocol that makes use of public key cryptography. It enables two parties to agree on a shared secret key without actually transferring the key itself. Instead, to obtain the shared secret key, each party creates a random integer and carries out a series of mathematical operations using their own private key and the other party's public key. It is much safer than conventional techniques of key exchange since the shared secret key is never really exchanged.

In conclusion, modern secure communications had to find a solution to the key exchange challenge because earlier key exchange techniques were not safe against interceptions and eavesdropping by adversaries. Key exchange protocols like Diffie-Hellman and public key cryptography have made it possible for parties to safely exchange keys without the usage of pre-shared keys or open directories.
