The defense in depth (DiD) approach is a cybersecurity strategy that involves implementing multiple layers of security controls to protect against various types of cyber threats. Each layer provides an additional barrier to prevent or mitigate an attack, and the goal is to make it more difficult for attackers to breach the system and access sensitive data or assets.

Here's an example of how implementing layers of cybersecurity (DiD) helps to protect a company's assets:

Let's say a company has a web application that is accessible to the public. The company can implement several layers of security controls to protect this application from potential cyber threats:

Layer 1 - Network Security: The first layer of defense could involve implementing network security controls, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to prevent unauthorized access to the network and the web application.

Layer 2 - Application Security: The second layer could involve implementing application security controls, such as input validation and access controls, to prevent common application-level attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Layer 3 - User Authentication and Authorization: The third layer could involve implementing user authentication and authorization controls, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access controls (RBAC), to ensure that only authorized users can access the web application.

Layer 4 - Endpoint Security: The fourth layer could involve implementing endpoint security controls, such as antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, to protect against malware and other threats that may target endpoint devices, such as laptops and mobile phones.

Layer 5 - Physical Security: The fifth layer could involve implementing physical security controls, such as surveillance cameras and access controls, to protect the physical infrastructure of the company, such as the server room where the web application is hosted.

By implementing multiple layers of security controls, the company can significantly reduce the risk of a successful cyber attack on its web application. Even if an attacker manages to bypass one layer of defense, there are still multiple layers of defense that they would need to overcome to access the sensitive data or assets. This makes it much more difficult and time-consuming for attackers to achieve their goals, and it increases the chances of detecting and mitigating the attack before significant damage is done.
