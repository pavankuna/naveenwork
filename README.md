Despite the fact that symmetric encryption is a potent encryption technique, it is not advised to use only symmetric encryption for all network-based applications due to many possible risks.

First, for symmetric encryption to work, the sender and receiver must share the same secret key. This implies that all the data that was encrypted with that key can be decrypted if an attacker obtains it. If a business only uses symmetric encryption, and an attacker is able to get their hands on the secret key, then all the data encrypted with that key is vulnerable.

Second, certain sorts of attacks, such as brute-force ones, which require testing every potential key until the right one is discovered, can exploit symmetric encryption. Longer key lengths can make brute-force assaults more challenging, but they can also add to the amount of work needed to encrypt and decrypt the data.

Third, large-scale systems may find it challenging to manage symmetric encryption. It can be difficult to distribute and manage the secret keys for all of these systems in a secure manner, for instance, if a corporation has thousands of users and hundreds of servers.
On the other hand, adopting symmetric encryption exclusively has the potential benefit of being faster and more effective than asymmetric encryption. Data encryption and decryption using asymmetric encryption require the use of two different keys, a public key and a private key, which can be slower and more computationally expensive.

Overall, symmetric encryption is a strong encryption technique with numerous real-world uses, but due to potential security risks and administration difficulties, it is not advised to use it as the sole encryption method for all network-based systems. Instead, a layered approach to security should be used, combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption with other security measures like access controls, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.
